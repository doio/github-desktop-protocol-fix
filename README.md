Github Desktop Protocol Handler Fix

A greasemonkey userscript that works around the bug that the beta GitHub Desktop client introduced. When one installs the beta client then switches back to using the stable Github Desktop client, "Open in Desktop" protocol handler links on the github.com website no longer work.

currently only accounts for the windows client, will be simple to add support for mac
(replace github-windows string with github-mac for now)
